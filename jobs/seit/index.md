### About the Job

LiveSafe builds software that makes individuals, campuses, and communities safer.  Our “social safety” products allow college students to easily connect with campus safety and security officials, as well as with each other.  Our users prevent incidents, react more quickly and safely during incidents, and expedite responses after incidents. Passion for building safer communities is in our DNA and we are serious about providing a high quality product that works every time someone needs it.

As our first testing-focused software engineer, you would provide expertise and leadership to evolve both testing-related technology and culture.  In your first month, you’d evaluate the key gaps in our testing practices, processes, tools, frameworks, and automation systems.  You would then work with the team and lead the charge in implementing and continuously improving the solutions that fill these gaps.

### About You

You most likely identify as a:

* Talented software engineer that happens to love the challenges that testing is heir to
* Polyglot that gets a special satisfaction from picking up a new language, framework, or tool
* Problem solver that does not relent until digging and discovering an issue’s root cause
* Collaborator that thrives in a social, transparent, and “got your back” team environment
* Builder who cares deeply that their creation realizes positive outcomes for our world

You can probably also:

* Describe the faults and shortcomings of your favorite language/tool/framework
* Name several pet software design principles that drives you nuts when not used

* Shipped an app to the Android and/or iOS app store
* Wrote automated tests for mobile platforms
